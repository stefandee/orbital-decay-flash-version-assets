# Orbital Decay Flash Version Assets

These are the assets used by Orbital Decay (Flash version). They were originally [released in 2012](https://www.pirongames.com/orbital-decay-graphic-assets-and-more/), as a means for fans to play around and maybe create their own spin-off/fan-made content based on Orbital Decay.

Please note that the [HTML5 version of Orbital Decay](https://www.pirongames.com/orbital-decay/) uses slightly different assets (different fonts, UI elements, etc).

## Usage
The sprites (in .xsprite format) can be opened using Sentry, which is part of [Piron Games C++ GameToolkit](https://github.com/stefandee/gametoolkit).

Pre-built binaries of Sentry are available for download [here](https://github.com/stefandee/gametoolkit/releases)
